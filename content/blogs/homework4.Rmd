# The Bechdel Test

<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/>

The [Bechdel test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a way to assess how women are depicted in Hollywood movies. In order for a movie to pass the test:

1.  It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2.  Who talk to each other
3.  About something besides a man

There is a nice article and analysis you can find here <https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/> We have a sample of 1394 movies and we want to fit a model to predict whether a film passes the test or not.

```{r read_data}

bechdel <- read_csv(here::here("data", "bechdel.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(test = factor(test)) 
glimpse(bechdel)

```

How many films fail/pass the test, both as a number and as a %?

```{r}
bechdel %>%
  # count number of observation per test value
  count(test) %>%
  # calculate number of observations per test value as percentage of total observations
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))


```

## Movie scores

```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel, aes(
  x = metascore,
  y = imdb_rating,
  colour = test
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3, size = 3) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("tomato", "olivedrab")) +
  labs(
    x = "Metacritic score",
    y = "IMDB rating",
    colour = "Bechdel test"
  ) +
 theme_light()
```

# Split the data

```{r}
# **Split the data**

set.seed(123)

data_split <- initial_split(bechdel, # updated data
                           prop = 0.8, 
                           strata = test)

bechdel_train <- training(data_split) 
bechdel_test <- testing(data_split)
```

Check the counts and % (proportions) of the `test` variable in each set.

```{r}
# train set
bechdel_train %>%
  # count number of observation per test value
  count(test) %>%
  # calculate number of observations per test value as percentage of total observations
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

# test set
bechdel_test %>%
  # count number of observation per test value
  count(test) %>%
  # calculate number of observations per test value as percentage of total observations
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

# the fail - pass split in both sets is about 55% which is consistent and in line with the split in the original dataset. We believe both the train and the test dataset are therefore representable.

```

## Feature exploration

## Any outliers?

```{r}

bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore) %>% 

    pivot_longer(cols = 2:6,
               names_to = "feature",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=test, y = value, fill = test)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~feature, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(x=NULL,y = NULL)

# Outliers can be observed for every variable. THe domestic and international gross revenue variable however seems to be particularly sensitive to outliers. To a lower degree, outliers are commen in the budget_2013 variable (and the imdb_rating). Therefore, there are indications it might be worhtwile to transform this data moving forward. 

```

## Scatterplot - Correlation Matrix

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore)%>% 
  ggpairs(aes(colour=test), alpha=0.2)+
  theme_bw()
```

```{r}
# First, we observe that international and domestic gross product is highly correlated. Consequently, it might be better to only corporate one of these variables into our model. Additionally, to a lesser extent we can draw the same conclusion in regards to the meta- and imdb score as critics generally seem to align their verdicts. Finally, a higher budget generally seems to lead to higher revenues but does not translate to better scores.

# second, in line with what we previously concluded, certain variables seem to have a highly skewed distribution. For example, budget and dom / inter gross revenue seem to be particularly highly skewed towards the rights. Potentially, the log or expenont of these variables is a more valuable predictor.
```

## Categorical variables

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following

```{r}
bechdel %>% 
  group_by(genre, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

# There seems to be a strong correlation between movie genre and the likelihood that the movie will pass the bechdel test. Action movies for example fail on about 70% of the occasion in comparison to an overall fail grade of 55%. Animations seem to have a higher likelihood to fail as well at 67% in contrast to comedies where the overal fail grade is only 43%.

bechdel %>% 
  group_by(rated, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))

# The rating seems to be slightly correlated but to a much lower extent than the movie genre. In addition, there might be an underlying correlation between rating and genre. Overall, most proportions seem to be in line with the expected overall averages in exception of the NC-17 rating. However, due to the low sample of 6 movies with this rating we cannot draw too much value to this observation.
```

# Train first models. `test ~ metascore + imdb_rating`

```{r}
lr_mod <- logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

lr_mod


tree_mod <- decision_tree() %>% 
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")

tree_mod 
```

```{r}


lr_fit <- lr_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )

tree_fit <- tree_mod %>% # parsnip model
  fit(test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, # a formula
    data = bechdel_train # dataframe
  )
```

## Logistic regression

```{r}
lr_fit %>%
  broom::tidy()

lr_preds <- lr_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel_train) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0))

```

### Confusion matrix

```{r}
lr_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")


```

## Decision Tree

```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_class, 1, 0)) 


```

```{r}
tree_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")
```

## Draw the decision tree

```{r}
draw_tree <- 
    rpart::rpart(
        test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
        data = bechdel_train, # uses data that contains both birth weight and `low`
        control = rpart::rpart.control(maxdepth = 5, cp = 0, minsplit = 10)
    ) %>% 
    partykit::as.party()
plot(draw_tree)

```

# Cross Validation

Run the code below. What does it return?

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bechdel_folds <- vfold_cv(data = bechdel_train, 
                          v = 10, 
                          strata = test)
bechdel_folds
```

## `fit_resamples()`

Trains and tests a resampled model.

```{r}
lr_fit <- lr_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )


tree_fit <- tree_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )
```

## `collect_metrics()`

Unnest the metrics column from a tidymodels `fit_resamples()`

```{r}

collect_metrics(lr_fit)
collect_metrics(tree_fit)


```

```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_mod %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, 
    resamples = bechdel_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE) #<<
  )

# What does the data for ROC look like?
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail)  

# Draw the ROC
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail) %>% 
  autoplot()

```

# Build a better training set with `recipes`

## Preprocessing options

-   Encode categorical predictors
-   Center and scale variables
-   Handle class imbalance
-   Impute missing data
-   Perform dimensionality reduction
-   ... ...

## To build a recipe

1.  Start the `recipe()`
2.  Define the variables involved
3.  Describe **prep**rocessing [step-by-step]

## Collapse Some Categorical Levels

Do we have any `genre` with few observations? Assign genres that have less than 3% to a new category 'Other'

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel %>% 
  count(genre) %>% 
  mutate(genre = fct_reorder(genre, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col(alpha = .8) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = (nrow(bechdel_train)*.03), lty = 3)+
  theme_light()
```

```{r}
movie_rec <-
  recipe(test ~ .,
         data = bechdel_train) %>%
  
  # Genres with less than 5% will be in a catewgory 'Other'
    step_other(genre, threshold = .03) 
```

## Before recipe

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel_train %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```

## After recipe

```{r}
movie_rec %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  bake(new_data = bechdel_train) %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```

## `step_dummy()`

Converts nominal data into numeric dummy variables

```{r}
#| results = "hide"
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

movie_rec 
```

## Let's think about the modelling

What if there were no films with `rated` NC-17 in the training data?

-   Will the model have a coefficient for `rated` NC-17?\
    No, the model will not have a coefficient for rated NC-17.

-   What will happen if the test data includes a film with `rated` NC-17?

    The model will throw an error in this scenario if nothing is done.

## `step_novel()`

Adds a catch-all level to a factor for any new values not encountered in model training, which lets R intelligently predict new levels in the test set.

```{r}

movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

```

## `step_zv()`

Intelligently handles zero variance variables (variables that contain only a single value)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) 
  
```

## `step_normalize()`

Centers then scales numeric variable (mean = 0, sd = 1)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) 

```

## `step_corr()`

Removes highly correlated variables

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) # %>% 
  # step_corr(all_predictors(), threshold = 0.75, method = "spearman") 
  # Professor told us to delete this line


movie_rec
```

# Define different models to fit

```{r}
## Model Building

# 1. Pick a `model type`
# 2. set the `engine`
# 3. Set the `mode`: regression or classification

# Logistic regression
log_spec <-  logistic_reg() %>%  # model type
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>%  # model engine
  set_mode("classification") # model mode

# Show your model specification
log_spec

# Decision Tree
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

tree_spec

# Random Forest
library(ranger)

rf_spec <- 
  rand_forest() %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")


# Boosted tree (XGBoost)
library(xgboost)

xgb_spec <- 
  boost_tree() %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 

# K-nearest neighbour (k-NN)
knn_spec <- 
  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 4) %>% # we can adjust the number of neighbors 
  set_engine("kknn") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 
```

# Bundle recipe and model with `workflows`

```{r}
log_wflow <- # new workflow object
 workflow() %>% # use workflow function
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>%   # use the new recipe
 add_model(log_spec)   # add your model spec

# show object
log_wflow


## A few more workflows

tree_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(tree_spec) 

rf_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(rf_spec) 

xgb_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(xgb_spec)

knn_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(knn_spec)

```

HEADS UP

1.  How many models have you specified?

    We have specified five models: logistic regression, knn, random forest, decision tree and XG boost.

2.  What's the difference between a model specification and a workflow?

    The model specification defines the model type and allows us to tune the model with our own parameter preferences. The workflow captures the entire data flow from preparation to deployment (aided by chatGPT).

3.  Do you need to add a formula (e.g., `test ~ .`) if you have a recipe?

    No, this is being derived from the recipe where it is pre-specified.

# Rubric

13/13: Problem set is 100% completed. Every question was attempted and answered, and most answers are correct. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output. Multiple Github commits. Work is exceptional. I will not assign these often.

8/13: Problem set is 60--80% complete and most answers are correct. This is the expected level of performance. Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). A few Github commits.

5/13: Problem set is less than 60% complete and/or most answers are incorrect. This indicates that you need to improve next time. I will hopefully not assign these often. Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. No Github commits.
