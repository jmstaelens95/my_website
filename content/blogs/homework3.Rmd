# Money in UK politics

[The Westminster Accounts](https://news.sky.com/story/the-westminster-accounts-12786091), a recent collaboration between Sky News and Tortoise Media, examines the flow of money through UK politics. It does so by combining data from three key sources:

1.  [Register of Members' Financial Interests](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-members-financial-interests/),
2.  [Electoral Commission records of donations to parties](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Donations), and
3.  [Register of All-Party Parliamentary Groups](https://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/standards-and-financial-interests/parliamentary-commissioner-for-standards/registers-of-interests/register-of-all-party-party-parliamentary-groups/).

You can [search and explore the results](https://news.sky.com/story/westminster-accounts-search-for-your-mp-or-enter-your-full-postcode-12771627) through the collaboration's interactive database. Simon Willison [has extracted a database](https://til.simonwillison.net/shot-scraper/scraping-flourish) and this is what we will be working with. If you want to read more about [the project's methodology](https://www.tortoisemedia.com/2023/01/08/the-westminster-accounts-methodology/).

## Open a connection to the database

The database made available by Simon Willison is an `SQLite` database

```{r}
sky_westminster <- DBI::dbConnect(
  drv = RSQLite::SQLite(),
  dbname = here::here("data", "sky-westminster-files.db")
)
```

How many tables does the database have?

```{r}
DBI::dbListTables(sky_westminster)
# 7 tables
```

# the database has 7 tables

## Which MP has received the most amount of money?

```{r}
# read payments table from SQL into R
payments_db <-  dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "payments")
# read members table from SQL into R
members_db <- dplyr::tbl(sky_westminster, "members")

# left join payments to members by matching member_id to id
left_join(payments_db, members_db, by=c("member_id" = "id")) %>% 
    # group by member id and name
    group_by(member_id, name) %>%
    # calculate sum of value per member_id and name
    summarize(total_amount_received = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    # sort in descending order by total_amount_received
    arrange(desc(total_amount_received)) %>%
    # return top row only
    head(1)

# Theresa May
  
```

You need to work with the `payments` and `members` tables and for now we just want the total among all years. To insert a new, blank chunk of code where you can write your beautiful code (and comments!), please use the following shortcut: `Ctrl + Alt + I` (Windows) or `cmd + option + I` (mac)

## Any `entity` that accounts for more than 5% of all donations?

Is there any `entity` whose donations account for more than 5% of the total payments given to MPs over the 2020-2022 interval? Who are they and who did they give money to?

```{r}
# left join payments to members by matching member_id to id
left_join(payments_db, members_db, by=c("member_id" = "id")) %>% 
    # group by entity
    group_by(entity, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
    # calculate sum of value per member_id and name
    summarize(total_amount_received = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
    # calculate prop of value donated by entity
    mutate(
        prop = total_amount_received / sum(total_amount_received), 
        na.rm = TRUE
      ) %>%
    # filter on entities with prop > 5%
    filter(prop > 0.05)

# withers LLP has donated more than 5% of all donations with a total of 1,81M donated
```

## Do `entity` donors give to a single party or not?

-   How many distinct entities who paid money to MPS are there?

```{r}
payments_db %>%
  # filter on payments > 0
  filter(value > 0) %>%
  # return all distinct entity names
  distinct(entity)

# there are 1000 distinct entities
```

-   How many (as a number and %) donated to MPs belonging to a single party only?

```{r}
# determine list of MPs belonging to a single party only
members_db_sp <- members_db %>%
  # count number of rows (party_id's) found per member id
  count(id) %>%
  # only keep rows where count == 1
  filter(n == 1)
 
### we find that all MPs belong to a single party only. Consequently, all payments or 100% is donated to an MP belonging to a single party only.

# left join payments to members by matching member_id to id
left_join(payments_db, members_db, by=c("member_id" = "id")) %>% 
    # group by entity, party_id
    group_by(entity, party_id) %>%
    # count number of parties an entity donated to
    count(entity) %>%
    # create column that indicates if party has only donated to one party
    mutate(
        loyal_TF = ifelse(n==1, TRUE, FALSE)
      ) %>%
    # ungroup table
    ungroup() %>%
    # count observations per loyal_TF
    count(loyal_TF) %>%
    # calculate proportion
    mutate(prop = as.numeric(n) / sum(as.numeric(n)))

# 62% of entities is loyal to a single party
```

## Which party has raised the greatest amount of money in each of the years 2020-2022?

I would like you to write code that generates the following table.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_table.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
library(stringr)

# left join payments to members by matching member_id to id
left_join(payments_db, members_db, by=c("member_id" = "id")) %>%
    mutate(year = sql("REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(SUBSTR(date, 1, 4), ' ', ''), '-', ''), '.', ''), '/', ''), ':', ''), '+', ''), '(', ''), ')', ''), '[', ''), ']', '')")) %>%
    group_by(year, party_id) %>%
    summarize(
      total_year_donations = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
  
```

... and then, based on this data, plot the following graph.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "total_donations_graph.png"), error = FALSE)
```

This uses the default ggplot colour pallete, as I dont want you to worry about using the [official colours for each party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Index_of_United_Kingdom_political_parties_meta_attributes). However, I would like you to ensure the parties are sorted according to total donations and not alphabetically. You may even want to remove some of the smaller parties that hardly register on the graph. Would facetting help you?

Finally, when you are done working with the databse, make sure you close the connection, or disconnect from the database.

```{r}
dbDisconnect(sky_westminster)
```
