# The Bechdel Test

<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/>

The [Bechdel test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a way to assess how women are depicted in Hollywood movies. In order for a movie to pass the test:

1.  It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2.  Who talk to each other
3.  About something besides a man

There is a nice article and analysis you can find here <https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/> We have a sample of 1394 movies and we want to fit a model to predict whether a film passes the test or not.
